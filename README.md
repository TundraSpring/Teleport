This is code that I'm creating as I'm learning Godot.
All of this is a work in progress, and many lines of code are temporary and will be improved in the future when I run out of things that are higher up on my list of priorities.
Right now the goal with this project is to learn, not to create a finished product. For that reason speed has been prioritized over quality in this particular project.
This is an exception, as I otherwise personally value quality a lot more than speed when it comes to code.

The project is currently developed and playtested in Godot 4.2.2. Parts of the code may break in other versions.

I have been less active as of late, as I have been busy with other work. I will resume working on this when I can.
